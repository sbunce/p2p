TODO

-A pair of encryption instantiations is needed for send/recv. Build the capability
in to encryption class with crypt_send and crypt_recv functions.

-Have a possible response to a P_SEND_BLOCK be a P_WAIT, which should trigger a
8 second wait before attempting another P_SEND_BLOCK request. It should also
trigger something with existing P_SEND_BLOCK requests. Should they be
re_requested immediately from other servers? There is a problem with un-expecting
responses. What about having a new command server->client that tells the client
buffer to un-expect?

-The total upload speed should include requests the client is making. Not just
server upload. Make a singleton for a speed_calculator for up_down speeds.

-Verify Mersenne Twister is working properly.

-encryption::PRNG is not being seeded properly by encryption::random_prime().

-It seems like client_buffer::post_recv should be able to be called by an append
buffer function or something.


WINDOWS PORTABILITY

-New line not working in terminal. \r\n?


DEFERRED FEATURES

-client::set_download_directory() not doing anything but saving setting.

-Hashes need to be removed for files that don't exist in share. Deferred because
it makes testing difficult.


IDEAS

-Don't allow clients to download who have the P2P port blocked. When a server is
connected to it should try to connect back to the client(more precisely the
server running at the address the client connected from). If the server can't
connect back it should deny the clients connection. This will make things
totally not work if there is NAT in the way or the server somehow isn't running.

-Let the user set up bandwidth profiles that can be quickly selected. The user
could create one for games/night time/bla bla. Then have a timer that can select
the profile based on time of day.

-Think about combining hash tree's in to one file. Keep track of starting
locations in DB. Perhaps have a memmove type opteration one a file where hashes
can be moved to get rid of gaps due to removed files. The intermediate step of
the memmove operation would basically be a journal.

-Encryption idea. Do diffie-hellman-merkle to get shared key. Seed a PRNG with
it to make a stream cypher.


GUI IDEAS

-When right clicking a download a option to get detailed info.

-A pulldown box in the preferences that lets you add directories to share.

-Replace IP in the search treeview with a description.

-Replace IP in the download treeview with a seeder/leecher count.


OVERLAY NETWORK IDEAS

-XOR key system where keys are a hash of IP addresses so that nodes are
organized by distance (distance measured in hops). Can keys directly be IP
addresses since they are unique and organized by network?

-Trackers which are organized in to a tree structure such that if the user adds
a tracker the user will also get to see the files of the trackers that tracker
trusts and the files that that tracker trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust
levels to direct trust only, one level inheritance and all level inheritance.
Children should be able to point to their parents.

-What about having one large overlay network reserved for tracker discovery.
Have a rule that says an individual can advertise a tracker once per day (or
some large time period). That'd make traffic on the large overlay very minimal.
