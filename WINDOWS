This application can be build with Microsoft Visual C++ Express.


DIRECTIONS:

Get Boost (lastest known to work 1.35.0):
http://www.boost.org/users/download/

1. Download both the Boost package and Boost Jam. Boost Jam is the tool the Boost
libraries are built with.

2. Extract the Boost package to C:\Program Files\Boost . Extract Boost Jam and
put bjam.exe in the Boost directory (C:\Program Files\Boost). The bjam.exe
program should be in the same directory as a file called Jamroot.

3. Open a cmd.exe prompt and navigate to C:\Program Files\Boost. Run the command
"bjam.exe". After the libraries are built in the same directory run
"bjam.exe install". This will install the boost libraries and headers to C:\Boost.


Get GTKMM (latest known to work (2.10.11-1)
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtkmm/

1. Download the latest gtkmm-win32-devel installer.

2. Install it. The gtkmm installer will offer to download and install gtk, do this.


Get Visual C++(latest known to work 2008

This one is trivial to install.


Configure Visual C++

Create Project:
File\New\Project From Existing Code.
Select Visual C++. *next*
Select src directory and give the project a name. *next*
Under "Project type" select "console application project". *finish*

Add GTK support:
Go to the property manager.
Right Click "Debug | Win32", select "Add existing property sheet" and select
	"C:\GTK\MSVC\gtkmm-2.4.vsprops".
Right Click "Release | Win32", select "Add existing property sheet" and select
	"C:\GTK\MSVC\gtkmm-2.4.vsprops".

Configure includes and linker for Debug:
Right click "Debug | Win32" and select properties.
Common Properties\"C\C++"\General. Set warning level to Off.
Common Properties\"C\C++"\General\"Additional Include Directories". Add "C:\Boost\include\boost-1_35"
Common Properties\Linker\General\"Additional Library Directories". Add "C:\Boost\lib"
Common Properties\Linker\Input\"Additional Dependencies". Add "ws2_32.lib"

Configure includes and linker for Release:
Right click "Debug | Win32" and select properties.
Common Properties\"C\C++"\General. Set warning level to Off.
Common Properties\"C\C++"\General\"Additional Include Directories". Add "C:\Boost\include\boost-1_35"
Common Properties\"C\C++"\General\Optimization. Set to full optimization.
Common Properties\Linker\General\"Additional Library Directories". Add "C:\Boost\lib"
Common Properties\Linker\Input\"Additional Dependencies". Add "ws2_32.lib"
Common Properties\Linker\System\SubSystem. Set to "Windows (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS)"
Common Properties\Linker\Advanced\"Entry Point". Set to "mainCRTStartup"


Attempt to Build Project:
If all is configured properly it should suceed. A directory named Debug or
Release will appear in the source directory depending on what you built. You can
switch between Debug and Release by going to the properties menu and down to the
configuration manager.


Copying Boost DLL's to the proper location:
Visual C++ Express doesn't allow static linking (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crippleware)
so you have to copy the DLLs to a path which is searched by the application when
it starts up. An easy place to copy DLL's is the directory with p2p.exe in it.
Attempt to start p2p.exe and it will complain about what it's missing. Copy these
DLL's to the directory with p2p.exe in it until it starts. Some renaming of the
DLL's might be required.
