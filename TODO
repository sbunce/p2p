TODO

-Add file_ID protocol stuff first.

-GUI lags on starting download when hashing is going.

-The client_buffer needs to be adjusted to pipeline more when sending commands
that expect smaller responses. This needs some thought because downloads might
expect different responses. Perhaps add a function to downloads that returns
their max possible response size and operate on that.

-Hash trees for missing files need to be deleted.

-Hashes need to be regenerated for files that have changed size (files hashed
while they were copying).


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. This will naturally
be added when hashes are checked. If a file we want to download has a root hash
that exists in the hashes folder then the file was already downloaded.

-Blacklisting of abusive clients/servers.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.

-Don't allow people to download who have the P2P port blocked. Make a ping
command the server can send to the client. The client should return a pong
otherwise it doesn't get to download.

-Download priority can be done by adding a "stickyness" to downloads in the
client_buffer. Have a value associated with downloads which makes them take
more calls to rotate_downloads() to actually rotate. Downloads should start on
normal. Possible settings low = 1, normal = 2, medium = 3, and high = 4.

-I want to have sharing such that someone just selects a folder(s) to share and
forgets about it. Perhaps combine this with allowing people to publish tracked
files on websites so you can still find the obscure stuff.

-Let the user set up bandwidth profiles that can be quickly selected. The user
could create one for games/night time/bla bla. Then have a timer that can select
the profile based on time of day.
