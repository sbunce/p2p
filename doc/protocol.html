<b>1.0 Abstract</b>
<blockquote>
The p2p library provides the means to connect to a global DHT (distributed
hash table) on which to lookup and download files from multiple hosts
concurrently.
</blockquote>

<b>2.0 Protocol</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Summary:
<br>
The protocol is symmetric with the exception of the key exchange. Any message
can go in either direction. All numbers are encoded in big-endian. The protocol
is entirely binary.
</p>
<p>
VLI (Variable Length Integer):
<br>
VLIs are used to save space. VLIs are used when we know the maximum value the
integer must hold. We know the maximum block number of a file so we can use VLIs
when requesting blocks. VLIs are a minimum of 1 byte and a maximum of 8 bytes.
</p>
<p>
Hash vs Root Hash:
<br>
The hash is a hash of the file size (8 byte big-endian) followed by the root
hash (20 byte SHA1 hash). Refer to the hash tree section for documentation on
the root hash.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.1 Key Exchange</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Each session starts with a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.

host_A initiates a connection with host_B.
g   = the generator both sides use that is always equal to 2
sA  = secret exponent of host_A
sB  = secret exponent of host_B
p   = prime host_A generates that both sides use
rA  = result of host_A, g^sA % p
rB  = result of host_B, g^sB % p
k   = secret key
MiM = Man in the middle.
^   = exponentiation symbol
%   = modulo symbol

The section header indicates who sees what.
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|     host_A      |   |       MiM       |   |      host_B     |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
| k = rB^sA % p   | = | g^(sA*sB) % p   | = | r_A^sB % p = k  |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
</pre>

<br>

<p>
host_A steps:
</p>
<fieldset>
<pre>
step 0: Send p and rA.

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|       p       |       rA      |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15  16    ...   31
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
step 1: Receive rB. Calculate shared secret.
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>
host_B steps:
</p>
<fieldset>
<pre>
step 0: Receive p and rA. Calculate shared secret.
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
step 2: Send rB.

+---+---+---+---+
|       rB      |
+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>
The shared secret is used to seed two RC4-drop768 PRNGs. One PRNG is for sending
and one is for receiving. Note that the RC4 PRNG is not very secure but this is
okay because the goal is obfuscation and not security. Key exchanges without a
PKI (public key infrastructure) are inherently insecure (vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle) anyways.
</p>

<p>
After the PRNG is seeded all bytes sent and received are XOR'd against the
output of the PRNGs. The send PRNG of Host_A remains synchronized to the recv
PRNG of Host_B and vise versa.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.2 Initial Messages</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
After key exchange the following messages are sent by both sides.
</p>
<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Message 0: local node ID
Description: Randomly generated 20 byte number. This number identifies the host
on the DHT.

+---+---+---+

+---+---+---+

N = local node ID

note: This is our node identifier on the DHT.

O = optional hash tree bit field, P = optional file bit field

note: The hash of the file_size and root_hash bytes is the hash the file is
tracked by. This should be verified before trusting the file_size and root_hash.

note: The root hash is block 0 of the hash tree.

possible status bytes:

messages.

have.

<b>2.5 Pipelining</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests, and a new request whenever a
response is received. This increases throughput because the sender will not be
idle waiting for a request.
</p>
<p>
A maximum of 16 (request_hash_tree_block + request_file_block) commands can be
pipelined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.6 Hash Tree</b>
<blockquote>

<p>
Merkle Hash Trees are used to distribute downloading of hash data needed to
verify the integrity of file blocks. The hash function used to generate the
tree is SHA1.
</p>

<p>
The bottom row of the tree consists of hashes for every 10240 bytes of the file
(however the last block may be shorter). Every row above the bottom row consists
of hashes for blocks of 512 hashes (may be less if there isn't 512 hashes left
in the child row).
</p>

<p>
The hash on the top of the tree is the root hash. The file size (8 byte
big-endian) with the root hash appended are then hashed together to get the hash
the file is tracked by.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.7 Limits</b>
<blockquote>
The maximum file size is 2^64 bytes.

Hash trees are currently stored in SQLite. SQLite blobs are limited to
2^31 - 1 bytes. Files which would generate hash trees larger than this won't be
hashed until this limitation can be addressed.
