TODO

-make request generator unit test

-requests should be sent before file blocks, when two hosts download from
eachother the file blocks hog upload that should be used to get requests out.


THINK ABOUT

-Using new primes must be forced. To do this old primes must be kept track of.
-Think about CMWC4096 PRNG seed issue. After key exchange, each client/server
sends 1/2 the size of the PRNG seed encrypted to the other.
-Think about how ISP might detect protocol via knowing handshake size/port.
Initial send sizes need to be be randomized? Perhaps do a modulo of some number
against the secret key, this could say how many extra random bytes to send.
-Possible system to do uploads. Favor the highest request, but assure that
requests are arriving sequentially. Actually this wouldn't have to be assured,
if someone started downloading mid file to try to get an advantage they might
have to wait a long time to download the beginning of the file.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-SQLite blob write offset is a signed int. This limits the maximum tree size
to 2gB. Create document like this: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html with size
limits.
-have temp directory for files that aren't done downloading
-client::set_download_directory() not doing anything but saving setting.
-Support for multiple share directories.
-Figure out how to handle naming conflicts. It should be fully automatic.
Probably just rename the files according to some rules. It doesn't matter too
much since the hashes stay the same.
-Have a tab that shows share stats, upload/download stats, duplicate files, etc.
-Make sure program works when out of hard drive space.
