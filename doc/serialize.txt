Serialize
=========
The serialization format is similar to protocol buffers. However, it is NOT
compatible.
http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/encoding.html#structure

The protocol consists of key/value pairs. The key is a vint (variable length
unsigned int) which specifies field ID and the wire format of the value.

vint
====
All vints are unsigned and little-endian. Each byte in a vint only uses 7 bits
to store data, the MSB (most sig bit) is used to indicate if there is another
byte in the vint. Vints can be a maximum of 10 bytes to support 64bit integers.

	+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | + | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0       7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                 byte 0                              byte 1

This example shows a vint which stores the number 128. Byte 0 has the MSB set to
indicate that another byte follows. Byte 1 doesn't have the MSB set to indicate
it is the last byte. Byte 1 has it's LSB (least sig bit) set which is a data
bit. Since the 8th data bit is set this vint is equal to 128.

Signed integers can be converted to unsigned by shifting them left by 1 and
using the LSB for the sign bit. This is necessary to be able to store signed
numbers in a vint. The code for this:

boost::uint64_t encode_int(const boost::int64_t x)
{
	return (x << 1) ^ (x >> 63);
}

boost::int64_t decode_int(const boost::uint64_t x)
{
	return (x >> 1) ^ -static_cast<boost::int64_t>(x & 1);
}


key
===
The key is a vint. The LSB of the key is the wire format. The rest of the key is
the message ID. If the LSB is set to 0 there will be a vint value. If the LSB is
set to 1 there will be a length delimited value. A length delimited value starts
with a vint that specifies how many bytes will follow it.

The reason for using the LSB of the key to indicate wire format is that we need
to be able to ignore unknown key/value pairs. This allows updating of the
protocol without breaking old clients.


message
=======
A message consists of one or more key/value pairs grouped together. A message is
prefixed with a vint that is the length (bytes) of the following message. The
message fields can be in any order.
